### Agent Design
- **Ingest Agent**: Reads documents, extracts and cleans text, splits into manageable chunks, embeds them, and stores them in a vector database for retrieval. Ensures that information is accessible and searchable.
- **RAG Agent**: Handles user queries by embedding the query, retrieving relevant document chunks from the vector database, and using a language model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.

## Agent and RAG Details
## Why Agents Are Used

Agents are used to modularize and organize the system’s functionality. Each agent is responsible for a specific task, such as document ingestion or question answering. This separation makes the code easier to maintain, extend, and debug.

- **Ingest Agent:** Specializes in reading, processing, and storing documents. By isolating this logic, the system can easily support new document types or ingestion methods in the future.
- **RAG Agent:** Focuses on retrieving relevant information and generating answers using AI. This modularity allows for flexible upgrades to retrieval or generation techniques without affecting other parts of the system.

**Benefits of Using Agents:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Scalability for future features
- Improved reliability and code organization

### Agent Design
- **Ingest Agent**: Reads documents, extracts and cleans text, splits into manageable chunks, and stores them for retrieval. Ensures that information is accessible and searchable.
- **RAG Agent**: Handles user queries by retrieving relevant document chunks and using a language model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- RAG combines document retrieval with AI generation. When a user asks a question, the system first searches for the most relevant parts of the ingested documents. Then, it uses a language model (like GPT) to generate a response based on both the retrieved information and its own knowledge.
- This approach improves accuracy and relevance, especially for questions about specific documents.
## Embedding Usage in the Project

Embeddings are a core part of this project, enabling semantic search and retrieval for RAG.

### Where Embedding Is Used

- **In `ingest_agent.py`:**
		- Uses `nomic.embed` to convert document chunks into embeddings (numerical vectors).
		- Stores these embeddings in a vector database (`chromadb`) for efficient retrieval.
		- Example:
			```python
			embeddings = embed.text(chunks)
			for chunk, embedding in zip(chunks, embeddings):
					collection.add(embeddings=[embedding], documents=[chunk])
			```
		- **Purpose:** Allows the system to search for semantically similar document chunks when answering questions.

- **In `rag_agent.py`:**
		- Embeds user queries using `nomic.embed`.
		- Compares query embedding to stored document embeddings to find the most relevant information.
		- Example:
			```python
			query_embedding = embed.text([query])[0]
			results = collection.query(embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=top_k)
			```
		- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and retrieval for the RAG process.

**Summary:**
Embeddings are used in both document ingestion and question answering to enable semantic search and improve the relevance of retrieved information. This is a core part of the RAG workflow in your project.

## Chunking: What It Is and Why It's Used

Chunking is the process of splitting a large document into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks). Each chunk contains a portion of the text that is meaningful on its own, such as a paragraph or section. This makes it easier for the system to search, retrieve, and process information efficiently.

**Why is Chunking Used?**
- Improves search accuracy by allowing the system to find and return only the most relevant parts of a document
- Makes processing large documents feasible for AI models
- Enables semantic search and retrieval at a finer granularity

**How Chunking Fits into the Workflow:**
1. The document is split into chunks during ingestion
2. Each chunk is embedded and stored in the vector database
3. When a user asks a question, the system searches for the most relevant chunks
4. The language model uses these chunks to generate accurate answers or summaries

Chunking ensures that the system can handle large and complex documents, providing users with accurate and contextually relevant information.

## Key Terms Explained

### Vector Database
A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors (lists of numbers). In this project, vectors represent text chunks or queries after being processed by an embedding model. Vector databases enable fast and efficient similarity search, helping the system find the most relevant document pieces for a user’s question.

### Chaining
Chaining refers to connecting multiple steps or components together in a sequence, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next. In language model applications, chaining allows you to build complex workflows, such as retrieving document chunks, summarizing them, and then answering a user’s question using the summary.

### Embedding
An embedding is a numerical representation of text (or other data) that captures its meaning in a way that computers can compare. Embeddings allow the system to perform semantic search, finding information that is contextually similar rather than just matching keywords.

### Agent
An agent is a modular component responsible for a specific task (e.g., document ingestion or question answering). Agents help organize code, improve maintainability, and allow for flexible upgrades.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG is a technique that combines retrieving relevant information from a database with generating answers using a language model. It improves the accuracy and relevance of responses, especially for questions about specific documents.

### Semantic Search
Semantic search uses embeddings and vector databases to find information based on meaning, not just exact words. This makes the system much smarter and more useful for answering complex questions.

### Language Model
A language model is an AI system trained to understand and generate human language. In this project, models like GPT or Llama are used to answer questions and summarize documents.

### User Interface
The user interface is how users interact with the system. In this project, Streamlit is used to create a simple and interactive web app for users to upload documents and ask questions.

### Environment Variable
An environment variable is a value stored outside the code, often used for configuration and secrets (like API keys). The `python-dotenv` package loads these from a `.env` file to keep sensitive information secure and separate from the codebase.

### Inference
Inference is the process of running a trained AI model to generate predictions, answers, or summaries based on new input data. In this project, inference happens when the language model generates responses to user questions.

### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or sentences, to make it easier for models to process and analyze.

### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves designing and refining the input prompts given to language models to achieve the best possible results. Well-crafted prompts can improve the accuracy and relevance of model outputs.

### Batch Processing
Batch processing means handling multiple data items at once, rather than one at a time. This can make document ingestion and embedding more efficient, especially for large datasets.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and tools that allows different software components to communicate. APIs are used to connect to external services, models, or databases.

### Metadata
Metadata is data that describes other data, such as document title, author, or creation date. Metadata can help organize, search, and filter documents more effectively.

### Testing
Testing refers to automated checks that ensure code works as expected. In this project, files like `test_ingest_agent.py` contain tests to verify that document ingestion and other components function correctly.

### Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is an isolated workspace for Python projects. It allows you to install and manage project-specific dependencies without affecting other projects or the system-wide Python installation.

**Why Use a Virtual Environment?**
- Prevents conflicts between different projects’ dependencies
- Makes it easy to reproduce and share your project setup
- Keeps your global Python installation clean and stable
- Essential for collaborative and production-grade development
