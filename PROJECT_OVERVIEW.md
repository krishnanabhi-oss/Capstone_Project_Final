# Project Overview
## Architecture Overview
- **Ingestion Agent:** Extracts and processes text from documents, splits the text into manageable chunks, creates embeddings, and stores them in a vector database.
- **RAG Agent:** Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to answer questions by searching the vector database and generating responses with a language model.
- **Vector Database:** Stores document embeddings for fast semantic search.
- **Language Model:** Generates answers and summaries based on retrieved information.
- **User Interface:** Built with Streamlit for easy document upload and question submission.
- Simple user interface
## Technologies and AI Models
- Python for all backend logic
- PyMuPDF for PDF extraction and chunking
- Hugging Face sentence-transformers for text embeddings
- ChromaDB for vector storage and search
- Llama models (via Ollama integration) for natural language understanding and generation
- LangChain for chaining components and managing agents
- Streamlit for the user interface
- Python
## Main Goals and Use Cases
This project is designed to make document understanding and information retrieval accessible to everyone. It is ideal for:
## Benefits and Unique Features
- Makes document search and Q&A fast and accurate
- Uses semantic search (not just keyword matching)
- Modular design for easy maintenance and future upgrades
- Private and secure: can run locally without sending data to external servers
- Scalable to support more document types and larger datasets
- Uses chunking to break large documents into smaller, meaningful pieces for better search and retrieval (see Technical Deep Dive for details)
## User Flow
1. The user uploads a document (PDF or text file) through a simple web interface.
2. The system processes the document, extracting and chunking the text.
3. The document is stored in a way that enables fast and smart searching.
4. The user asks questions or requests summaries.
5. The system uses AI to find relevant information and generate human-like answers or summaries.
6. The user receives clear, concise responses instantly.

## Summary
This project acts as a smart assistant for your documents, combining cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly interface. It is suitable for anyone who needs to quickly understand, search, or summarize complex files.
